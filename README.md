# Nightvision - Goggles are Goggles

This is a submod for the Rimworld mod [Nightvision by drumad](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1464989530).
It patches all the base mod goggles (Tinted Goggles and night Vision Goggles) so that they belong to the "Eyes" layer instead of "Headgear", allowing you to wear them in combination with hats and basic helmets.
